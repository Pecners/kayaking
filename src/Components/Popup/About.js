        <p>This is a personal project for me to practice React.
        I like to kayak, and most of the time I launch at South Shore Yacht Club.
        When I am thinking about taking my kayak out, it's often easy to know
        what the temperature is and what the probability of rain/storms is.
        What is more difficult to find is the wave and wind forecast. This app
        presents exactly what I want to know when I'm determining if I want to
        kayak or not.</p>
      </div>
